Project Repository Overview
1. Workflow: deploy-frontend.yml
Location: .github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml

Purpose: This GitHub Actions workflow automates the deployment of a frontend application to an Amazon S3 bucket and manages the CloudFront distribution.

Overview:

Name: Deploy to S3
Trigger: Runs when changes are pushed to the main branch.
Job Definition: Runs in an ubuntu-latest environment.
Detailed Steps:

Checkout Repository:
Uses actions/checkout@v4 to clone the repository's content, enabling subsequent steps to access the files.
Sync Files to S3:
Runs aws s3 sync to synchronize local project files to the specified S3 bucket, deleting obsolete files and excluding .git files.
Uses GitHub secrets for AWS credentials and the S3 bucket name.
Invalidate CloudFront Cache:
Runs aws cloudfront create-invalidation to clear the CloudFront cache, ensuring updated files are served.
Utilizes the CloudFront distribution ID and AWS credentials stored in GitHub secrets.
Key Benefits:

Facilitates continuous delivery by automating the deployment process whenever a push to main is detected.
